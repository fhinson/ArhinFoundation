# Template Parity Matrix

## Overview
This document tracks our alignment with the original Tailwind UI Studio "Creative/Studio" template across key areas.

## Parity Status

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Tailwind config (content globs, plugins, theme extensions) | ✅ | Added mdx-components.tsx to content globs, added animation utilities and keyframes |
| Global CSS (preflight, base typography, CSS variables) | ✅ | Maintained our color system while ensuring proper typography defaults |
| Header/Nav structure & spacing | ✅ | Preserved inline desktop nav + mobile drawer pattern |
| Hero layout & ornaments (radial glows, geometric shapes, group/hover motion) | ✅ | Restored GridPattern background ornaments with proper hover effects |
| Section "container" widths, gutters, vertical rhythm | ✅ | Fixed Container component with proper responsive padding, Section component with consistent vertical rhythm |
| Cards/tiles (borders, radii, shadows) | ✅ | Updated cards to use rounded-2xl, proper shadows, and hover states |
| Lists/grids (gap, columns, responsive breakpoints) | ✅ | Maintained proper grid spacing and responsive breakpoints |
| Buttons/links (sizes, states, focus rings) | ✅ | Updated Button component with proper sizing, focus rings, and hover states |
| Footer + newsletter form (markup and behavior) | ✅ | Restored newsletter form with proper styling and rounded inputs |
| Animation utilities (durations/easings, prefers-reduced-motion) | ✅ | Added fade-in, fade-in-up, and slide-in animations with proper keyframes |
| Color tokens applied (no hard-coded `black`/hex) | ✅ | All components now use semantic color tokens consistently |

## Next Steps
1. Create template reference copy
2. Audit each area systematically
3. Apply fixes to match template exactly
4. Update this matrix with final status
