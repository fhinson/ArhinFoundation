Mission

Title tag: Our Mission | Arhin Foundation
Meta description (≤155): We advance timely, culturally aware youth mental-health support by funding access, talent, and stigma reduction.
H1: Our Mission

Mission paragraph:
We advance timely, culturally aware mental-health support for children. We remove friction to quality care and back the people who deliver it—so more young lives feel steady and free to pursue ambition.

What we fund:
	•	Access — direct support that moves young people from waitlists to care (sessions, clinic capacity).
	•	Talent — supervision, training, and early-career support for clinicians.
	•	Stigma — consent-first programs and content that make seeking help normal.

Initial allocation: 70% Access · 20% Talent · 10% Stigma

Values: Dignity · Focus · Evidence · Culture · Leverage · Accountability

Approach: Small portfolio. Clear outcomes. Light reporting. Privacy respected—no personal stories required for impact.

Internal links:
	•	See our specific targets in Our Work.
	•	Read more About Francis Kumi Arhin.

Purpose: Provide supervision stipends and continuing-education support for early-career clinicians serving youth in diverse communities.
Year-1 target: Fund 8–12 micro-grants [editable].
We’ll track: Clinicians supported and training types completed.

Stigma Micro-grants (pilot)

Purpose: Fund small, consent-first creator or community projects that normalize help-seeking among young people.
Year-1 target: Award 6–10 micro-grants [editable].
We’ll track: Meaningful engagement (saved/rewatched/shared resources), not raw impressions.
Rights & consent: All content is consent-first; grantees retain rights while granting the Foundation limited, non-exclusive use.

Privacy note: No personal stories are required to show impact. Consent first, always.
Safeguarding note: All direct programming is delivered with vetted partners and appropriate child-safety protocols.

Final prompt for Cursor (no code, implementation-ready)

Goal: Replace template copy and meta with the finalized Arhin Foundation content below, keep the voice understated, ensure accessibility/SEO, and avoid publishing internal strategy notes. No “Donate” button until payments are live.

	2.	Page copy + SEO
	•	For each page, set title tag, meta description, H1, body copy, CTA(s), internal links, and image alt text exactly as provided in the “Final launch-ready copy” section.
	•	Keep meta descriptions ≤155 characters; do not truncate or add extra adjectives.
	3.	Internal links
