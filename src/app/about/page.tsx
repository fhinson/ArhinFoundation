        <p>
          We believe that every young person should feel like they can chase their dreams. That mental health care shouldn&apos;t depend on zip code, income, or who you know. That a child&apos;s potential shouldn&apos;t be limited by struggles they never chose.
        </p>
        <div className="mt-10 max-w-2xl space-y-6 text-lg">
          <p>
            We&apos;ve seen too many bright, resilient kids wait months for help. Too many families navigate a system that feels designed to keep them out. Too many communities left to solve these problems alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            This drives everything we do. We&apos;re passionate about changing what feels unchangeable: turning closed doors into open ones, long waitlists into real appointments, and isolation into connection. Every grant, every partnership, every dollar is guided by one conviction: that care should reach the kids who need it most.
